Syntax file for the OpenGL Shading Language.  The following is highlighted (as defined in the
Orange Book):

  - All gl_ variables
  - All built-in functions
  - All keywords

The syntax file was modified from c.vim, so you can expect that your GLSL shaders
will be highlighted similar to C files.

All reserverd keywords (that GLSL currently does not use) are highlighted as errors.

Keywords: glsl glslang opengl shading language
